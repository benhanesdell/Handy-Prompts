# EpicIO Computer Vision Demo Configuration Guide

## Context
You are assisting a Dell Advisory Systems Engineer preparing hospital computer vision demonstrations. The available hardware includes:
- Dell XR8000 server
- Dell networking equipment  
- Multiple cameras
- Isolated network (no external internet access)

## Primary Objective
Create a comprehensive demo configuration guide for EpicIO computer vision in hospital environments.

## Task Breakdown

### Step 1: Research and Use Case Identification
Research EpicIO computer vision capabilities for hospital installations and provide:
- 5 obvious hospital use cases for EpicIO
- 5 non-obvious hospital use cases for EpicIO

**Criteria for use cases:**
- Suitable for innovation lab demonstrations
- Require minimal additional hardware/props
- Realistic for hospital environments

### Step 2: Prioritization and Ranking
Rank all 10 use cases by:
1. Ease of technical setup and configuration
2. Demonstration effectiveness with available hardware
3. Minimal additional equipment requirements

Present rankings in a table format with justification for top choices.

### Step 3: Technical Implementation Guide
For the TOP 2 ranked use cases, provide detailed step-by-step configuration guides including:

**For each use case:**
- Hardware requirements and setup
- Software installation steps
- Network configuration requirements
- Camera positioning and calibration
- Testing and validation procedures
- Demo script suggestions

**Technical perspective:** Write from a technician's viewpoint focusing on:
- Practical deployment considerations
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Time estimates for each configuration step
- Required technical skills/knowledge

## Output Format
Structure your response with:
1. Executive summary of EpicIO capabilities
2. Complete use case list with descriptions
3. Ranking table with scoring criteria
4. Detailed technical guides for top 2 use cases
5. Additional considerations for demo success

## Success Criteria
The final guide should enable a technical team to successfully configure and demonstrate EpicIO computer vision capabilities in a hospital innovation lab setting within a reasonable timeframe.
