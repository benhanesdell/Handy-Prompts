# Data Center Buildout: Collaborative Strawman Document Development

## Context & Objective
You are tasked with creating a comprehensive strawman document framework that will guide a multi-disciplinary team through the planning, design, and implementation of a new enterprise data center facility. This document serves as the foundational blueprint for cross-functional collaboration and iterative refinement.

## Target Audience & Stakeholders
The document must accommodate input from the following specialist roles:
- Facility planners and architects
- Power and cooling infrastructure engineers
- Rack design specialists
- Server hardware experts
- Storage systems architects
- Data network engineers
- Product specialists (servers, storage, networking equipment)
- Data center colocation facility experts
- Cloud gateway integration specialists
- Program managers (strategic oversight)
- Project managers (tactical execution)

## Required Document Structure
Create a detailed project package that includes:

1. **Executive Summary & Project Charter**
   - Business justification and ROI projections
   - High-level timeline and budget parameters
   - Success criteria and key performance indicators

2. **Requirements Gathering Framework**
   - Stakeholder interview templates by specialty
   - Technical requirement matrices
   - Capacity planning worksheets
   - Compliance and regulatory checklists

3. **Solution Design Methodology**
   - Design review gates and approval processes
   - Integration points between specialty areas
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Technology evaluation criteria

4. **Infrastructure Planning Templates**
   - Physical space allocation models
   - Power and cooling load calculations
   - Network topology diagrams
   - Equipment procurement schedules

5. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Phase-gate delivery approach
   - Installation sequencing and dependencies
   - Configuration management procedures
   - Testing and validation protocols

## Collaboration Framework
Define how team members will:
- Share information and maintain version control
- Resolve conflicts between competing requirements
- Escalate decisions requiring executive approval
- Track progress against milestones

## Constraints & Assumptions
Address typical data center project limitations:
- Budget boundaries and cost optimization strategies
- Timeline constraints and critical path dependencies
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Environmental and sustainability considerations
- Scalability and future expansion planning

## Output Format
Present the strawman document as a structured template with:
- Clear section ownership assignments
- Standardized formatting and terminology
- Built-in review and approval workflows
- Measurable deliverable definitions for each phase

Ensure the document enables immediate team mobilization while remaining flexible enough for iterative refinement based on stakeholder feedback and evolving requirements.
