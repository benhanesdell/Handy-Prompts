## üß∞ PPE Detection Module: Installation & Setup Guide

### üîç Overview
EpicIO‚Äôs **DeepInsights‚Ñ¢ AI platform** includes a PPE Detection Module that can identify whether individuals are wearing required protective gear (e.g., masks, gloves, gowns, face shields). This module is part of the **DeepVision** video analytics suite and is compatible with edge deployments like the Dell XR8000[1](https://www.epicio.com/video/).

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

#### 1. **Prepare the Environment**
- Ensure Dell XR8000 is powered and connected to isolated network.
- Assign static IPs to cameras and server.
- Install Docker and NVIDIA GPU drivers.

#### 2. **Download and Extract Software**
```bash
wget https://assets.epicio.com/dell/epic_stack_v2.2.tar.gz
tar -xzvf epic_stack_v2.2.tar.gz
cd epic_stack_v2.2
```

#### 3. **Deploy DeepVision Stack**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- This launches DeepVision, DeepInsights‚Ñ¢, and the PPE Detection Module.

#### 4. **Configure Cameras**
- Access DeepVision dashboard via browser (`http://<XR8000-IP>:8080`)
- Add cameras using ONVIF or RTSP streams.
- Define detection zones (e.g., entryways, PPE-required areas).

#### 5. **Enable PPE Detection**
- In the DeepInsights‚Ñ¢ dashboard, activate the **PPE Detection Module**.
- Select PPE types to monitor (mask, gloves, gown, face shield).
- Set alert thresholds and notification preferences.

### üß™ Validation & Testing

1. Simulate entry with full PPE.
2. Simulate entry missing one item (e.g., no mask).
3. Observe dashboard alerts and logs.
4. Adjust detection sensitivity if needed.

### üßØ Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue | Fix |
|------|-----|
| No camera feed | Check RTSP/ONVIF stream and firewall rules |
| PPE not detected | Recalibrate detection zones and lighting |
| Module not loading | Verify Docker containers and GPU availability |
