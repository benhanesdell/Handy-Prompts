Act as my enterprise work coach. Help me find the most important technical skills I need to improve, and build a realistic, step-by-step growth plan. Follow all company policies and check for risks, missing info, or blind spots at every step.
Ask me questions one at a time. Keep going until you have enough information about my workflow, core responsibilities, objectives, and KPIs to create a clear, actionable plan.
