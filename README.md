## Using Markdown for Prompt Libraries

Handy Prompts is organized around Markdown (.md) files for storing and managing all Large Language Model (LLM) prompts. Each prompt lives in its own Markdown fileâ€”so you can easily access, edit, version, and reuse them. This approach supports modern AI workflows, robust version control, and GitHub collaboration.

### Why Markdown?

- **Human-readable**: Markdown uses simple formatting syntax, making prompts easy to read and edit, even for beginners.  
- **Structured & Modular**: Prompts, metadata (name, description, tags), parameters, and examples can be grouped using headers and bullet points. This keeps large prompt libraries organized and scalable.  
- **Collaboration**: Handy Prompts uses consistent Markdown formatting for all prompts, enabling safe and predictable team contributions.  
- **Version control**: Markdown files are tracked like code using Git, making branching, reviews, and history seamless.  
- **Automation-ready**: Markdown is supported in many documentation and AI tooling platforms, allowing prompts to be parsed, rendered, and deployed automatically.  
- **Validation**: Editors such as Visual Studio Code and Obsidian offer Markdown preview and linting to catch formatting issues before you commit changes.  

### Best Practices

- Store each prompt in its own `.prompt.md` file inside the `/prompts/` folder.  
- Use consistent heading levels and bullet formatting.  
- Standardize metadata sections across all prompt files.  
- Preview Markdown formatting before committing changes.  
- Document and link your Markdown prompt files in this README to aid discoverability.  
- Use pull requests and helpful commit messages for collaborative updates.

Browse the `/prompts/` directory to discover, copy, adapt, or contribute prompts for your LLM workflows.
