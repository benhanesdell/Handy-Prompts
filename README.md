## Using YAML for Prompt Libraries
Handy Prompts is organized around YAML (.yml) files for storing and managing all Large Language Model (LLM) prompts. Each prompt lives in its own YAML fileâ€”so you can easily access, edit, version, and reuse them. This approach supports modern AI workflows, robust version control, and GitHub collaboration.

### Why YAML?
- Human-readable: YAML uses simple key-value pairs and indentation, making prompts straightforward to read and edit, even for beginners.
- Structured & Modular: Prompts, metadata (name, description, tags), parameters, and examples are grouped under logical parent keys. This keeps large prompt libraries organized and scalable.
- Collaboration: Handy Prompts uses standard YAML schemas for all prompts (name, description, model, messages, tags), enabling safe and predictable team contributions.
- Version control: YAML files are tracked like code using Git, making branching, reviews, and history seamless.
- Automation-ready: YAML is natively supported in leading AI frameworks and GitHub Actions, allowing prompts to be parsed, validated, and deployed automatically.
- Validation: Editors such as Visual Studio Code and Notepad++ offer built-in YAML linting to catch syntax errors before you commit changes.

### Best Practices
- Store each prompt in its own .prompt.yml file inside the /prompts/ folder.
- Use spaces (never tabs) for indentation.
- Standardize key names and schemas across all prompt files.
- Validate YAML syntax before committing changes.
- Document and link your YAML prompt files in this README to aid discoverability.
- Use pull requests and helpful commit messages for collaborative updates.
